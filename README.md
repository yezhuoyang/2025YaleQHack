In this challenge, we explore two different area to demonstrate the power of new language feature, as well as software-hardware codesign. First, we implement error correction code such as repetition code and surface code. With the help of modularized design and function reusing, we show that we can also implement simple logical algorithm with surface code. We also use recursion to implement fault-tolerant syndrome measurement. Second, we implement a second-order Trotterized time evolution simulation of the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM)â€”a paradigmatic strongly correlated system exhibiting two distinct phases determined by the competition between spin-spin interactions and external transverse fields.By adiabatically tuning the Hamiltonian parameters, our simulations successfully detect the crossing of the critical point separating these phases. Furthermore, we optimize the quantum circuit to minimize the number of required pulses, demonstrating an efficient quantum simulation protocol for the TFIM. We have also put a lot of effort in figuring out the compilation automation pipeline, such that all of our algorithm can be compiled down to atom movements, we also use video to demonstrate our compilation. In the contest, we find some potential bugs in the provided packages. 

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this set of projects, you should be able to:
- Implement quantum error correction codes including repetition codes and surface codes using Kirin's conditional programming features
- Design fault-tolerant measurement circuits using recursive programming techniques in Bloqade
- Simulate the transverse field Ising model using Trotterized evolution to observe quantum phase transitions
- Implement and optimize variational quantum algorithms for finding ground states in multiple physical models
- Apply circuit optimization techniques to maximize gate parallelism for neutral atom quantum hardware
- Design efficient qubit placement and routing solutions for zoned neutral atom architectures
- Visualize quantum algorithms at the hardware level with atom movements and Rydberg operations
- Identify and troubleshooting in quantum programming frameworks

### 3. Circuit optimization

To run the circuit optimization, you need to specify the qasm file and the optimization method. The qasm file should be in the `./examples/circuit-optimization/qasm/` directory. The optimization method can be one of the following:
- `zx-qiskit`: This method uses ZX calculus to optimize the circuit.
- `qiskit-bloqade-parallel`: This method uses ZX calculus to optimize the circuit and then uses UOpToParallel to optimize the circuit.
- `zx-qiskit-bloqade-parallel`: This method uses UOpToParallel to optimize the circuit.

An example of running the optimization is as follows:
```bash
python ./examples/circuit-optimization/run_optimization.py --qasm_file ./examples/circuit-optimization/qasm/opt-qiskit.qasm --method zx-bloqade-parallel
```


### 4. Circuit visualization

Before running the visualization, one need to perform layout synthesis and get the architecture-specific instructions. An example of such instructions is in `./examples/circuit-visualization/surface-code-1-aod.json`. An example of architecture specification is in `./examples/circuit-visualization/arch-1-aod.json` The json file is generated by ZAC (see `https://github.com/UCLA-VAST/ZAC`).

Before running video generation, you need to install ffmpeg. This is required for the animation generation. You can install it using the following commands (for `Ubuntu`):
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

For Mac, you can use Homebrew:
```
brew install ffmpeg
```

Run `./examples/circuit-visualization/animation.py` to visualize the circuit. You may want to change the output file path in the main function to save the animation to a different location. For example:

```bash
python ./examples/circuit-visualization/animation.py --json_file ./examples/circuit-visualization/surface-code-1-aod.json --architecture_file ./examples/circuit-visualization/arch-1-aod.json --mpeg_file ./examples/circuit-visualization/surface-code-1-aod.mp4
```
