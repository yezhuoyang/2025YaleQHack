The json file is generated by ZAC (see `https://github.com/UCLA-VAST/ZAC`). 

Run `python animation.py --json_file <path_to_json_file> --architecture_file <architecture_file>` to visualize the circuit. You may want to change the output file path in the main function to save the animation to a different location.
