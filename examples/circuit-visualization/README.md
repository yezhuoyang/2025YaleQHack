## Circuit visualization

Before running the visualization, one need to perform layout synthesis and get the architecture-specific instructions. An example of such instructions is in `./examples/circuit-visualization/surface-code-1-aod.json`. An example of architecture specification is in ``./examples/circuit-visualization/arch-1-aod.json` The json file is generated by ZAC (see `https://github.com/UCLA-VAST/ZAC`). 

Before running video generation, you need to install ffmpeg. This is required for the animation generation. You can install it using the following commands (for `Ubuntu`):
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

For Mac, you can use Homebrew:
```
brew install ffmpeg
```

Run `./examples/circuit-visualization/animation.py` to visualize the circuit. You may want to change the output file path in the main function to save the animation to a different location. For example:

```bash
python ./examples/circuit-visualization/animation.py --json_file ./examples/circuit-visualization/surface-code-1-aod.json --architecture_file ./examples/circuit-visualization/arch-1-aod.json --mpeg_file ./examples/circuit-visualization/surface-code-1-aod.mp4
```
